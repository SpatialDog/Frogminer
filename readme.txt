FROGminer Beta Test 

What is this?
tl;dr ~ Free CFW for USA, EUR, JPN ~

!tl;dr - This differs from previous iterations of seedminer in that homebrew, instead of System Settings, is used to import/export the dsiware (this eases size restrictions). 
Also, eshop dsiware is not needed or used this time. Instead, a different dsihax game, flipnote studio JPN v0, is injected into an internal dsi system app.
This particular v0 of flipnote is needed because all 4 other regions/versions throw an error and kick you back to home menu if it cannot find its
save file on NAND. System dsiware titles do not have saves and you cannot import a modified system dsiware that has one.

Fincs and Wintermute - Flipnote Lenny, a revised version of ugopwn. This is the version I ported. Very clean, elegant work which made it a more manageable task for me.
